# TokenMimic
TokenMimic is a security tool designed to demonstrate process token manipulation and privilege escalation in Windows environments. This tool allows users to impersonate another process's token and elevate privileges to perform system-level operations.

**Features**
Open Target Process: Access and open the target process using its Process ID (PID).
Retrieve Access Token: Obtain the security token of the target process.
Impersonate User: Temporarily act as the target process's user.
Duplicate Token: Create a duplicate of the target process's token.
Launch New Process: Start a new process (e.g., command prompt) with the same privileges as the target process.


**Use Cases**
Demonstrating token manipulation techniques.
Testing privilege escalation scenarios.
Learning and understanding Windows security and access tokens.


**How to Use**
Clone the repository.
Compile the source code using a compatible C++ compiler.
Run the executable with appropriate process ID and observe the privilege escalation.


**Disclaimer**
This tool is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Unauthorized use of this tool on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical.
