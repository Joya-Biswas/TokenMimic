Locally impersonating a user and elevating privileges.
Opening a process on a remote machine by establishing a network connection.
Listing token privileges and starting a new process using the duplicated token.
The repository provides a practical implementation using C++ and Windows API, showcasing security and administrative capabilities for system administrators and developers interested in system-level programming.

Key Features:

Impersonating logged-on users to elevate privileges.
Networking capabilities to open processes on remote machines.
Token management and privilege escalation.
